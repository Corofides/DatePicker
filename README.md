# Date Picker

This is a date picker for React Native I'm working on. I've been working on a Gym Application and I've been using some components for it.
However, I keep having issues with extensibility which I'm hoping to explore via this.

It's loosely based off the @react-native-community/datetimepicker component.

I'm not sure how serious this will be but I'm hoping to find a way that I can create a component for my onw use that will work
as a decent datepicker and in doing so explore ways of structuring react components that lend to extensibility in the UI and functionality

A lot of the time I feel like react native components / libraries have a tendency to force you to do certain things and I'd like to
explore this.
